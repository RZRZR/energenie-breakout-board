Errors:
* Energenie module points the wrong way.
* Rogue ground thread shorts out data pin.

Assembling the board.


1. **DO THIS BEFORE SOLDERING ON THE HEADERS**. Disconnect ground thread at the cross roads to prevent shorting. You can do this with a scalpel. Make sure you cut in parallel with the silkscreen line as shown.
